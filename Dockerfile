## We copy these into the 'build' image first (COPY creates an image layer). and then install the dependencies
## npm ci is the same as npm install, except it will follow strictly the dependencies in the package-lock.json. It's also a bit faster (largely because of that).
RUN npm ci
## Create another layer with COPY that includes all our stuff.  The idea is that your code/config is going to change at a higher rate than your dependencies.
## This will honor the .gitignore file
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

## This will be the "final (real)" image. I'm using nginx:latest -

## This is the output from the build above
